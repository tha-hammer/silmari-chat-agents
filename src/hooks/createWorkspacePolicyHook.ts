/**
 * Workspace boundary policy as a `PreToolUse` hook.
 *
 * Local-engine file tools enforce a hard workspace boundary at the
 * tool implementation layer (`resolveWorkspacePathSafe`). This hook
 * adds a complementary, host-controlled layer on top that uses the
 * standard PreToolUse / HITL machinery to *negotiate* access to
 * paths outside the workspace — instead of just throwing.
 *
 * The host opts in by registering this hook on a `HookRegistry`; the
 * hook inspects each tool call's input, extracts the file paths it
 * mentions via per-tool extractors, and returns:
 *
 *   - `allow`               — every path is inside `workspace.root`
 *                              (or `additionalRoots`)
 *   - `deny`                — at least one path is outside, and the
 *                              configured outside-policy is `'deny'`
 *   - `ask`                 — at least one path is outside, and the
 *                              outside-policy is `'ask'` (default).
 *                              When `humanInTheLoop.enabled` is true,
 *                              the existing PreToolUse `'ask'` flow
 *                              raises a tool_approval interrupt the
 *                              host UI can render. When HITL is off,
 *                              `'ask'` collapses to `deny` (matches
 *                              the rest of the SDK's default).
 *
 * Default per-tool path extractors cover the local-engine coding
 * suite (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `grep_search`,
 * `glob_search`, `list_directory`, `compile_check`). The host can
 * override or extend via `pathExtractors`. Bash/code paths are not
 * extracted by default — bash command parsing is its own concern, and
 * the existing `bashAst` validator + sandbox-runtime fs allowlist are
 * the right gates for those.
 *
 * Important: this hook does NOT replace `resolveWorkspacePathSafe`.
 * Even if the hook returns `allow`, the file tool still enforces its
 * own clamp unless `workspace.allowReadOutside` /
 * `workspace.allowWriteOutside` (or the legacy
 * `allowOutsideWorkspace`) is set. The recommended composition for
 * "ask the user" semantics is:
 *
 *   workspace: {
 *     root,
 *     allowReadOutside: true,
 *     allowWriteOutside: true,
 *   },
 *   // …with the hook installed and humanInTheLoop.enabled = true.
