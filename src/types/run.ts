/**
 * Cooperative mid-generation preemption. Lets a host seal the live model
 * stream at the next provider-safe token boundary — the run is never
 * aborted, the partial assistant turn is kept, and the graph self-loops
 * into a fresh model call once the `PreemptBoundary` hook has injected
 * whatever the host queued.
 *
 * Preconditions the host MUST satisfy:
 *   - `shouldPreempt` is polled once per streamed chunk on the top-level
 *     graph. It must be synchronous, allocation-free and O(1) — never I/O.
 *     It must also be LEVEL-TRIGGERED (non-consuming): the SDK never clears
 *     the host's request, and a true result is only honored once the
 *     accumulated chunk is provider-safe, so the predicate may be polled
 *     many times before a seal. A one-shot read that clears its own pending
 *     flag would silently lose the request on an unsafe chunk (leading
 *     whitespace/reasoning, an in-flight tool call) — keep returning true
 *     until the `PreemptBoundary` drain hands over the queued injection,
 *     then disarm there.
 *   - Sealing is only honored on the SDK's own dispatch loop. A run whose
 *     registered `CHAT_MODEL_STREAM` handler IS the SDK dispatcher — or wraps
 *     it, which `composeEventHandlers` and `createRunHandlers` both do —
 *     consumes chunks through a decoupled `streamEvents` reader that can lag
 *     the accumulated chunk, so those runs never seal.
 *
 *     Detection is by capability, not identity: the dispatcher carries
 *     `SDK_STREAM_DISPATCH` and the SDK's wrappers propagate it. A handler
 *     that merely OBSERVES the raw chunk echo — LibreChat's no-op
 *     `OpenAIChatModelStreamHandler`, say — is unbranded and does NOT disable
 *     sealing, because it assigns no content-part indices and so cannot be
 *     inverted. A host that renders from the raw feed and wants the opt-out
 *     should brand its handler with `SDK_STREAM_DISPATCH`.
 *   - `RunConfig.tokenCounter` should be set. A sealed turn ends before most
 *     providers send their usage chunk, so the synthetic `CHAT_MODEL_END`
 *     falls back to the counter to report `output_tokens`. Without one that
 *     fallback silently no-ops and the sealed turn's usage is lost — verified
 *     live: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and DeepSeek report no usage for the sealed
 *     segment without a counter, while Anthropic streams usage incrementally
 *     and reports it either way.
